# Running a Monitor

Monitors can be executed manually or can be scheduled to run automatically at predefined intervals.

API monitors, by default, will have a monitoring schedule attached that runs at 12AM UTC time automatically.

## How we run the monitor?
Please refer [execution sequence](execution-sequence) for more details on how an API monitor is executed.

## Run Manually

1. Navigate to [API Monitors](https://app.devraven.io/app/apiMonitors) page.
2. Click **Run monitor** to trigger an adhoc run for the monitor.
3. Monitor run will be executed from all selected monitoring locations for the monitor.
4. The API monitoring results will be displayed automatically in few seconds.

## Change Schedule

Refer [Change Schedule](/docs/monitor-configuration/change-schedule) page for more details about changing monitoring schedules.
