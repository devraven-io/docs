## Delete a Workspace

Workspace deletion is an irreversible operation. All monitors, settings, historical data related to a Workspace will be permanently deleted.

5. A banner will also be displayed for the Workspaces that are scheduled to be deleted.

## Cancel a Workspace deletion
Once a Workspace deletion is requested, the request can be canceled by any Workspace users with Admin role before the scheduled deletion time.
