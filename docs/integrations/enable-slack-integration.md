### Enabling Slack integration

1. Navigate to [Global Alert Channels](https://app.devraven.io/app/settings/alert-channels) page in Workspace Settings.
2. Click **Activate Slack integration** button.

5. Close the popup when prompted.
6. **Global Alert Channels** screen will show the Slack Channel name and Workspace configured with your Workspace.
