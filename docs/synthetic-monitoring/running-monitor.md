## Run Manually

1. Navigate to [Synthetic Tests](https://app.devraven.io/app/syntheticTests) page.
2. Click **Run Test** to trigger an adhoc run for the test.
3. Test will be executed from all selected monitoring locations for the test.
4. The test results will be displayed automatically in few seconds.

## Change Schedule
