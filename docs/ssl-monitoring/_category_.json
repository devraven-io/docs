Though most cloud service providers provide automated tools and processes for automatic deployment and renewal of SSL certificates, for varieties of reasons there are environments that still have semi-automation or manual processes for renewing and deploying SSL certificates. Such environments that lack full automation for managing SSL certificates or monitoring are prone to SSL certificate related outages"
