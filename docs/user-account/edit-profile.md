# Edit Profile

Navigate to [Edit Profile](https://app.devraven.io/app/profile) to change your user profile information. 

## Updating Name

We recommend adding your name by visiting [Edit Profile](https://app.devraven.io/app/profile) page. This helps other workspace users to see the user's name instead of email address while using the product.

## Changing email address

You can change the associated email address for your user account from [Edit Profile](https://app.devraven.io/app/profile) page. Email address change will be permitted if there are no other user accounts using the same email address.

:::note

Changing the email address also results in change of login username for the user account. You must use the new email address for subsequent logins.
