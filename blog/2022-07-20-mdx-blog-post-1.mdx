Reusable functions is one of the most asked feature by our early access customers. Reusable functions help prevent duplication of code across multiple monitoring checks.

Functions defined in a Workspace can be invoked from Scripts in Synthetic Tests or API monitoring checks. For more details about Functions, refer the documentation [here](/docs/functions/overview).

PagerDuty integration is now available. More details on [PagerDuty website](https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/devraven/) and also refer our documentation [here](/docs/integrations/pd-integration)

New availability of persistence APIs to write/retrieve values to temporary storage for monitoring complex dependent scenarios. Refer documentation [here](/docs/api-monitoring/preserving-values)

As we get closer to public availability of the product, we also integrated with Stripe for subscription management and billing. We also clarified our [Pricing](https://www.devraven.io/pricing.html) details on our public website.

Few other updates include:

* Changes to Home screen to show usage details
* Changes to Home screen to show TODO items.
* Documented publicly available APIs in [API monitoring checks](/docs/api-monitoring/available-apis) and [Synthetic tests](/docs/synthetic-monitoring/available-apis)
* few bug fixes
